        <h1>Take Care</h1>
<p>How to Work Better (1991) is a well-known work by Swiss artists Peter Fischli
and David Weiss. It consists of a ten-point manifesto that the artists found,
enlarged, and had painted on the side of a building in Zurich. Their instructions
are meant as a self-motivating reminder and description of their own process as
artists, but are also directed to the rest of the world as a propositional code of
conduct or ethic of behavior — in fact, a copy of How to Work Better is pinned to
the wall of countless artist studios around the world, as well as above the desks
of many curators, including this one.</p>
<p>The question of how to work or how to behave is one that lies at the root of
all of our decisions. To rehearse a common truism: it’s not just what you do, it’s
how you do it — it’s not just what artists or curators do, but how they behave
when they do it. Beyond the different styles, techniques, or themes that
characterize their work are the different codes of conduct that guide the
way they act or behave. The same could be said of museums or art institutions:
running alongside the question of what they are showing is the question of how
they are behaving.</p>
<p>In recent years, small organizations around the world have been formulating
different answers to that question. They are taking risks not just with what art
to show but also with how to work and how to behave as an institution. In
other words, in addition to having an adventurous and forward-thinking curatorial
program, they are experimenting with new institutional and curatorial
methodologies that articulate a new ethic of behavior and a new code of conduct.
As a result, they are outlining a context for what it means to propose an
alternative today. My own effort towards this, with The Artist’s Institute in New
York, is but one proposition among many others.</p>
<p>With mainstream museums and commercial galleries often showing
uncommercial work by uncommercial artists, the role historically played by
alternative spaces has been made somewhat redundant. Now is a time when
MoMA shows performance art, the Whitney shows site-specific art, the
Guggenheim shows institutional critique, and the New Museum shows
artists who are Younger Than Jesus (2009). Commercial galleries such as
Reena Spaulings or Alex Zachary allow the most prominent collectors to buy
work by the most uncompromising artists. And those smaller organizations that
manage to stay non-profit and independent soon find themselves invited by the
Tate Modern’s “No Soul for Sale” (2010) or the ICA’s “Nought to Sixty” (2008).
While these mainstream or commercial structures might take risks with what they
show, few take risks with how they work. In most cases, they produce
exhibitions, one after the other, and strategically compete for larger audiences
and for more widespread recognition. The challenge for a contemporary
alternative space or curatorial approach is to behave differently.
<p>For example, the logic and structure of exhibitions could itself be called
into question. Much of the difficulty with making an exhibition lies in the
fact that to extract something from circulation — an object, image,
practice, or idea — and interrupt it, examine it, and exhibit it, is to do it a
great injustice. The philosopher Bruno Latour, among others, discusses the life
of things, referring, in the largest sense, to all that which is usually not considered
to be cognizant human subjects: objects, pictures, rocks, animals, natural
systems, etc. These things, he argues — objects, images, and ideas included —
have their own agency and won’t simply sit still under someone else’s
microscope, on someone else’s terms. In fact, what makes them compelling is
precisely what animates them, what they want, and how they behave when they
are set loose into the world. In other words, objects, images, and ideas have lives
to live, and instead of conceiving of an exhibition as a way to reign them in and
use them to carefully prove a point, an exhibition could be something much
riskier: a way to discover, along with the audience, how that point will behave and
where it will wander as it lives its life. In this sense, the opening of an exhibition
could mark the beginning of a curatorial idea, not its end. </p>
<p>Traditionally, it’s the other way around: curators open their shows and play the
role of explicators, working to enlighten visitors who don’t know what they know.
They are expert performers of the I Know and avoid displaying any sign of the I
Don't Know. Instead, an alternative curatorial behavior could be to embrace
a more vulnerable relationship to knowledge. An institution could stop
behaving like an explanation machine, where those who know are teaching
those who don’t know, and invest in what philosopher Jacques Rancière calls the
equality of intelligences, where those who know something engage with those
who know something else. It’s not about preparing explanations in advance, but
about following the life of an idea, in public, with others.
Clearly, the goal is not to reject the expertise of the I Know in favor of the
anti-intellectualism of the I Don’t Know, but to step outside of that binary
entirely. Following the art critic Jan Verwoert
, it means performing both the I Know and the I Don’t Know in the key of the I Care. Verwoert suggests the I
Care as an act of giving what you don’t have to people who don’t want it, or, in
other words, as an act that is more affective than it is effective. If an institution
goes from knowing to caring, it could point to the affective relationship that ties
people to ideas and become a place for attachment rather than consumption.
After all, the ideas that make us curious are not the ones we fully understand, but
the ones we care about — I Love It is always more compelling than I Get It.
In unpacking the I Care, Verwoert also points to the importance of the figure of
the muse: he or she who inspires and influences you — or, etymologically
speaking, who amuses you. Funnily enough, one tends to think of the curator as
being the artist’s host, inviting him or her into an institution, but it’s actually the
other way around: we are the guests of the artists we choose to work with. In
that context, like for any other houseguest, we should find a way to say
Thank You. An exhibition could be an homage instead of a lesson—a way
to thank artists, not dissect them.</p>
<p>Curatorial responsibility involves the invention of ways to appropriately pay tribute
to the lives of artworks and artists—not the invention of curatorial methods for
their own sake. By always putting the artist first, a good exhibition behaves
like a guest who takes care to do whatever is true to the spirit of the work.
To pay homage to someone falls somewhere between admiring them and
studying them. A tribute is neither an analysis nor just a party. Giving a toast is
about making people care, not about making them understand. The act of
appreciation, by nature, is not didactic — it’s what you like, not what you know —
but it is social: it involves not just what you like, but caring about it so much that
you want to share it with others. It’s more than naming a favorite book, it’s
recommending it. The affective curatorial approach of the I Care can inhabit that
space between an homage and an explanation, between a tribute and an
analysis, between a recommendation and a nomination. Once again, this is a
place where the I Know co-exists equally with the I Don’t Know, in the form of the
I Care. While the uptown museums conduct their art historical power games and
the downtown galleries conceive their elusive tactics and smart chess moves,
those eager for another model could perform the vulnerable, dangerous, and
radical act of wearing their heart on their sleeve.</p>
<p>While behaving in the key of the I Care can be an act of celebration, it can
also be one of critique: the art of the toast is closely aligned with the art of
the roast. An alternative and affective curatorial behavior involves the
biting quip and critical edge of parrhesia — to use a term resurrected by
Michel Foucault3 — or fearless speech. To practice parrhesia is to have the
courage to speak frankly from a position of exposed vulnerability. Unlike the
careful and calculated strategies of a much safer practice of rhetoric—the debate
of differences between equals — parrhesia involves a willingness to stand for
irreverent or critical values from the perspective of a less powerful member of the
community, and is certainly relevant to those smaller and more vulnerable
institutions.</p>
<p>To care also means to take care and to pay attention, and in order to
properly do that, as argued by philosopher Bernard Stiegler4
, we need to
slow down and take our time. While museums build more buildings, produce
more exhibitions, raise more money, place more ads, and hope to draw more
crowds, another model could be to do less and spend more time with what
we do. Rather than feeding the conveyor belt of the next, next, next, we
could stop channel surfing and demand a more focused and sustained
attention span. One way organizations do this is by simply repeating
themselves: year after year, the commercial gallery Miguel Abreu in New
York, for example, repeatedly hosts a screening of films by Jean-Marie
Straub and Danièle Huillet, insisting on their sustained relevance to the
gallery’s identity and program as a whole. Another way many organizations
take their time is by emphasizing research over exhibitions: if exhibitions
traditionally last six to ten weeks, research-based initiatives allow for the pursuit
of speculative questions over longer periods of time, leading to more in-depth
and textured thinking. BAK in Utrecht, for example, commits several years to
thinking through a single theme through exhibitions, publications, conferences, or
private roundtables, all placed on equal footing. Mamco in Geneva, although far 
from being a smaller alternative space, conceives of an exhibition as a single
program that evolves over several years, made manifest in a series of episodes.
Another mainstream yet relevant institution, the Dia Art Foundation in New York,
not only presents single exhibitions that last a minimum of eight months, but is
also committed to maintaining (and caring for) expensive long-term projects such
as Walter De Maria’s The Lightening Field (1977) or Earth Room (1977). While
many galleries and art centers seem seduced by Hans-Ulrich Obrist’s
dontstopdontstopdontstop (2006), others aren’t, and prefer to stop.</p>
<p>The media, of course, always favors the fast and the furious. Therefore,
stepping off the conveyor belt also means falling out of the news cycle, and
behaving this way will inevitably draw smaller audiences. This smaller scale
does come with several advantages: not only is it much cheaper to
maintain a smaller physical space, but this intimacy will also favor a faceto-face encounter and demand a more active and immediate engagement.
Organizations such as Salon Populaire or Silberkuppe in Berlin, Kunstverein in
Amsterdam, Pro Choice in Vienna, Front Desk Apparatus in New York,
castillo/corrales in Paris, or New Jerseyy in Basel are no larger than 100 square
meters, and are designed with that very characteristic in mind.
Since they invest in face-time rather than in ad-time, these small institutions
build their audience as the result of a self-selecting process. In other words,
the people who pay attention are not the ones who are encouraged to do so, but
the ones who choose to do so. Since anyone is invited to attend any of the
exhibitions or events, this is not a case of speakeasy or strategic exclusivity, but
it effectively creates a space for self-selected and engaged community of
people who care. The goal is not to engage in a competition to attract more
audiences, but to establish a smaller gift economy for anyone who is
curious enough and makes the effort to come by for a visit, whether a
friend or a stranger.</p>
<p>More than anything, the challenge for a contemporary alternative space
today is to behave the way Martin Luther King Jr. called upon all people to
behave: to be maladjusted. By evoking a term usually associated with a
psychological defect or illness, Dr. King famously declared that he was proud to
be maladjusted, and that he would never adjust himself to a society that
discriminates against racial minorities. In the art context, these smaller
institutions are proud to be maladjusted: they do not adjust themselves to
an art community obsessed with knowledge, power, and scale. Instead, they
step onto the smaller and more vulnerable roads and allow learning to replace
teaching, camaraderie to replace competition, the homage to replace the
explanation, and the dance move to replace the chess move.</p>
<p>As a tribute to Fischli & Weiss, let me conclude and summarize by proposing an
updated set of instructions for a contemporary ethic of curatorial behavior. It
could certainly hang over the desk at The Artist’s Institute. </p>
